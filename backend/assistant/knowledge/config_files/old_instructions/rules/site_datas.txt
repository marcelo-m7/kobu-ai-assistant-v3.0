When looking at a given layout with text you don’t really need to rationalise the text to understand the message. From type you can understand if the message is soothing, aggressive, and so on.

n nnIntroducing the Okaasan® Serif TypefacenHey guys! In my last article, I wrote about the typographic process behind Kaito® Sans typeface. Now it’s Okaasan® Serif’s turn. This digital typeface is a serif typographic font inspired by the 1800’s rational mood of the Enlightenment thinking. Its serif reveals a modern high contrast between thick and thin elements, fitting a Didone style.', metadata={'source': 'https://kobu.agency/the-lab-report/okaasan-serif-maternal-essence/', 'loc': 'https://kobu.agency/the-lab-report/okaasan-serif-maternal-essence/', 'lastmod': '2020-01-21T22:22:33+00:00', 'changefreq': 'weekly', 'priority': '0.7'}), Document(page_content='Typographic illustration with the character “a” of Okaasan Serif', metadata={'source': 'https://kobu.agency/the-lab-report/okaasan-serif-maternal-essence/', 'loc': 'https://kobu.agency/the-lab-report/okaasan-serif-maternal-essence/', 'lastmod': '2020-01-21T22:22:33+00:00', 'changefreq': 'weekly', 'priority': '0.7'}), Document(page_content='By the way, the Didone style was born by the hands of Firmin Didot, Giambattista Bodoni and Justus Erich Walbaum, early 19th century typographers, but this style first emerged in the late 18th century.

Well, first of all, our inspiration – the Mother figure. All mothers are different and unique, but they all share some characteristics that shape their behaviour and perception of life itself.

Mothers demonstrate an unmatched strength to protect their children while also being sensitive and gentle. Mothers represent a safe harbour as they are unbreakable and convey hope.
